        These Terms of Service (individually and together with the Community
        Guidelines, "Terms" or "Agreement") are between RiceBox Lab, Inc.
        ("Mouthful," "we," "our," "us") and you, an individual user ("you,"
        "your," "yours"), and govern your use of Mouthful’s website or mobile
        software applications that have been made available on the Mouthful
        website or for download (each, an "App," and together, the Apps) and
        any related websites or other online properties owned or controlled by
        Mouthful (together with the Apps, the "Service").
      </p>
      <h3>1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute a legally binding contract between you and
        Mouthful.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that by clicking on one of the "Account Creation Options''
        (Google, Facebook, Phone Number, Email) or similar, registering,
        accessing or using the Apps or the Service, you are agreeing to enter
        into a legally binding contract with Mouthful (even if you are using
        our Apps or Service on behalf of a company). The Agreement includes
        these Terms and Mouthful’s
        <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service cannot be provided and the Terms cannot be performed
        without Mouthful processing information about you and other users.
        Processing of the information you share with Mouthful is essential to
        the Service which we provide and is a necessary part of our
        performance of the Agreement. Our
        <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>
        describes how we collect, use, share, and store your personal

          Content: (i) that Mouthful considers to violate these Terms or
          applicable law; (ii) that Mouthful considers to be Objectionable

        <li>
          User Content Posted by Others. Although Mouthful reserves the right
          to review or remove any User Content, we do not review all User
          Content, and we take no responsibility for the User Content that

        <li>
          In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Mouthful in the most expedient and cost effective
          manner, you and Mouthful agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your
          use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in
          court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery
          than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and
          relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in
          any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
          termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND
          MOUTHFUL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS
          AGREEMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE STATUTES OF THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO, CANADA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 18.1 above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude,
          or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii)
          pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, province or state, or local agency if that action
          is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or
          (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arbitrator. If any dispute arises between the Parties relating to the application, interpretation,
          implementation or validity of this agreement, the Parties agree to resolve the dispute by arbitration using
          the Canadian Arbitration Association Expedited Arbitration Rules. The parties agree that the Canadian
          Arbitration Association Expedited Arbitration Rules give the parties a fair opportunity to present their case
          and respond to the case of the other side. The arbitration shall be held in Toronto, Canada (or virtually) and
          shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act (Ontario). The arbitrator has exclusive
          authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this
          binding arbitration agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a notice of the dispute to the other
          party ("Notice"). Mouthful's email address for Notice is: legal@riceboxlab.com. The Notice must: (i) describe
          the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The
          parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an
          agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Mouthful may commence an arbitration
          proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Mouthful must not be
          disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
          dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award, Mouthful will pay you the
          highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; or (2) the last written settlement
          amount offered by Mouthful in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.
        </li>
        <li>
          Waiver of Class Actions. YOU AND MOUTHFUL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
          ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
          PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Mouthful agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
          than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND MOUTHFUL AGREE TO WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT
          AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JURY. You and Mouthful are instead electing to have claims and disputes
          resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Mouthful over whether to vacate or enforce an
          arbitration award, YOU AND MOUTHFUL WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if Mouthful makes
          any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Mouthful’s address for Notice, you may
          reject the change by sending Mouthful written notice within 30 days of the change to Mouthful’s address for
          Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected,
          will continue to govern any disputes between you and Mouthful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Mouthful can force the
          other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Mouthful in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming
          subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Mouthful username
          and the email address you used to set up your Mouthful account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement
          that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either email your opt-out notice to
          legal@riceboxlab.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforceability. If Section 18.5 above is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 18 will
          be null and void. If this Arbitration Provision is invalidated in whole or in part, Section 19 shall govern
          any claim in court arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service.
        </li>

      </ol>
      <h3>19. VENUE</h3>
      <p>To the extent a claim, dispute, or controversy arises out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of
        the Service that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 18, both you and Mouthful agree that all
        such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the courts of the Province of Ontario, Canada and all
        courts competent to hear appeals therefrom. If that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation,
        then such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the The Superior Court of Justice (Ontario,
        Canada). You and Mouthful consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p>
      <h3>20. TIME FOR FILING</h3>
      <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST MOUTHFUL MUST BE COMMENCED BY FILING A
        DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION UNDER SECTION 18 (OR BY FILING AN ACTION UNDER SECTION 19 TO THE EXTENT SECTION 18 DOES
        NOT APPLY) WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF
        THE ACT, OMISSION, OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. YOU AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR
        ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.</p>
      <h3>21. INDEMNITY</h3>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Mouthful harmless from and
        against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees,
        arising or resulting from: (a) your breach of this Agreement; (b) your access to, use, or misuse of Mouthful
        Content or the Service; or (c) your User Content.</p>
      <p>Mouthful will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Mouthful reserves the right to
        assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section if
        Mouthful believes that you are unwilling or incapable of defending Mouthful’s interests. In such case, you agree
        to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Mouthful’s defense of such matter at your expense.</p>
      <h3>22. ADDITIONAL TERMS</h3>
      <p>From time to time, Mouthful may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that it makes
        available to you in connection with your use of the Service or in connection with a special promotion
        ("Additional Terms"). Except as expressly stated otherwise, such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into
        and subject to this Agreement. This Agreement will control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with
        the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.</p>
      <h3>23. SEVERABILITY</h3>
      <p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the
        invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which
        will remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <h3>24. LOCAL LAWS</h3>
      <p>We control and operate the Service from Mouthful’s headquarter in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mouthful
        makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful, or available for use in any
        location other than Canada. Those who choose to access or use the Service from locations outside Canada, do so
        on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
        applicable. Access to the Service from jurisdictions where the content or practices of the Service are illegal,
        unauthorized, or penalized is strictly prohibited.</p>

        legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>
      <p>Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim
        that any App or your possession and use of any App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights.
        You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Apps. Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries,
        are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the
        right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party
        beneficiary of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>You hereby represent and warrant that: (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a Canadian
        Government embargo, or that has been designated by the Canadian Government as a "terrorist supporting" country;
