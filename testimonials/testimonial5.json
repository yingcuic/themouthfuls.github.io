  "testimonial": "This is one of the most wholesome, safe, nurturing, and non-judgmental communities I’ve ever been a part of. If you struggle with social anxiety or speaking, I can’t recommend this community enough! The hosts and members are incredibly humble, knowledgeable, encouraging, and kind. There are speaking practices almost every day, and they are extremely well-organized and structured. Everyone is respectful to one another, and everyone gets the chance to speak (or just listen, if you prefer). I've only been in this community for one month, but I can already feel a difference in my speaking ability and in how I feel about myself. Please join this community—you won’t regret it!",
