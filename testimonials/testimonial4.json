  "testimonial": "I was searching for a Discord community that suited me, and I came across The Mouthfuls. I struggle with speaking and social anxiety, but I really enjoy the people in this community—they’re great! The community is full of respectful, non-toxic individuals who are always ready to listen and offer positive feedback with lots of love. I attend events when I can, though it's a process—just like everything else. I keep showing up and participating when I’m able. The Mouthfuls also has text-based channels, which are great for easing in if you're feeling hesitant. It feels like a social network to me. If you’re reading this, just know—it’s okay to put yourself out there. There’s an event for just about everyone, so don’t hesitate to join The Mouthfuls. You won’t be disappointed.",
