  "testimonial": "Nothing compares to The Mouthfuls! You're missing out if you haven’t clicked that join button yet. Here’s why: nurturing and engaging hosts, respectful members, and a well-organized, neat server. Combine all three, and you get a warm, positive culture that not only improves your speaking skills but helps you grow as a person. The more time you spend with the people here, the more you’ll become like them—which is amazing because many members are well-spoken, and you can learn from them. This supportive environment has slowly become part of my behavior. I’m now more confident in speaking, more open in appreciating others, and better at addressing issues. The benefits just keep coming—I could talk about this forever! But the best way to confirm my words is to see and experience it for yourself. Join this server now! See you there~",
