  "testimonial": "We all fear judgment, especially when we make mistakes during conversations. This often leads us to believe we're introverts and that we'll never develop social skills or improve our communication. Here, you'll find people who are accepting of your mistakes, offering feedback to help you grow and become better. Youâ€™re free from judgment in this safe environment, where making mistakes is part of the process. You can improve, connect with people from different countries, interact with them, and learn new perspectives.",
