  "testimonial": "Before joining this community, I was shy and awkward, feeling like my voice didn’t matter anywhere. But within just a few weeks, The Mouthfuls helped ease my anxiety and gave me confidence in what I have to say. As a result, I can now speak in other communities, and people actually listen. Best of all, I was struggling with communication at work, but this community gave me the skills to express myself, and now, for some reason, people listen to me there too. Where I once felt stifled due to a lack of social skills, this community has set me free, and I’m so grateful. Through events and practice groups, it continues to help me improve. This community is special. While it feels like a safe space, people aren’t afraid to discuss important topics that might spark disagreement, and there’s a consensus to always remain respectful. People here understand the value of listening, which is rare. It’s a very practical community, and the culture of the community and its members is focused on aiming high and making the world a better place. I never thought a Discord community could be so civil and have such a positive impact on people. I’m glad I found this gem.",
