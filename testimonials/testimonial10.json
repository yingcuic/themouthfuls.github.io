  "testimonial": "It’s rare to find a community free of negativity, marketing, and biases these days, whether online or offline. The Mouthfuls is one of those rare exceptions. When I joined the community a few months ago, I wasn’t sure if the people would be friendly or if I’d get enough practice. But my doubts disappeared after the first session. The community offers a variety of practice opportunities, and everyone gets a chance to speak. The hosts are warm and welcoming, and the participants are all like-minded. If you're looking for an online community to improve your speaking skills, there’s no better place than The Mouthfuls.",
