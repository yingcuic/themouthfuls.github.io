  "testimonial": "My first impression of The Mouthfuls was that it was an encouraging, non-judgmental, and positive community, and it has always remained that way for me. The turn-based impromptu speaking practice sessions truly make an impact because everyone gets a fair chance to speak on a prompt. This server helped me become more confident in expressing myself verbally and reduced my social anxiety. Before joining, I had so much anxiety that I never had the courage to speak in a Discord voice call. The Mouthfuls was the first community where I finally spoke in a voice call and gained more confidence! Because of this, I even got the confidence to become a Helper within the server. I want others to experience the same personal and professional growth I've had—and that could be you, the person reading this! So if you’re still hesitating to join The Mouthfuls, don’t worry, we understand. You can always listen in on events and see if it’s the right fit for you. :)",
