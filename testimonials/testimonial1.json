I had been on Discord since 2017, but I had never once spoken in a voice call—not because I didn’t want to, but because fear held me back. Speaking in English, especially, made me feel small. It wasn’t my first language, and I was deeply insecure about my voice, my accent—everything. I was studying Social Work, and at the end of my first year, I was told—bluntly—that I might not be good enough because of my communication skills. It was crushing. It confirmed my worst fear: that my voice wasn’t strong enough, clear enough, good enough. But somewhere deep inside, I knew I wanted to change that. That’s when I found The Mouthfuls. I was drawn to the idea of impromptu speaking, but I stayed quiet for months—just observing, texting, slowly feeling the warmth of the community. There was something special here. A space where no one judged, where people supported each other just for trying. Eventually, I spoke. And then I spoke again. And again. Every time, I felt a little stronger. And as I grew, I started helping others—first as a Helper, then by hosting events, and now, I’m honored to support and guide other volunteers as a Senior Helper leading our Helper Team. The most unexpected thing I’ve learned through this journey is that I actually enjoy public speaking. Before Mouthfuls, I never saw that in myself. Now, I see it not only as a skill, but a passion—something I want to keep developing and sharing. Now, in April 2025, I can say with full heart: The Mouthfuls helped me find my voice when I thought I’d never hear it. And now, I use that voice to uplift others—just like this community once did for me.",
