  "testimonial": "I’ve been hosting at The Mouthfuls since 2021, and it’s one of the few things that I’ve stuck with so consistently for so long—and I’m really proud of that. I especially enjoy the creative process of writing prompts, often involving satirical takes on trending news. I also enjoy hearing the diverse perspectives they spark at each of my events. It’s been a meaningful, grounding part of my life.",
