  "testimonial": "As an unconventional, introverted, unmarried, zany, and neurodivergent person, I've felt defective all my life. I was always technically excellent at jobs but got pushed out because of my personality. The fact that relatives, partners, and friends couldn't accept me in the long term felt like yet another failure that was all my own fault. The burden seemed to be 100% on me to change myself to fit in, but I believed that others should try to meet me somewhere in the middle. I was at an impasse, and it was lonely. With The Mouthfuls, I've learned to celebrate my differences along with the group. Here, my age, race, nationality, and quirks don't matter. I'm learning to refine myself because it's something I want to do, not because I'm being forced to do it. I sometimes even earn trophies for being myself, which is something I never thought would be possible for me in this lifetime. If you're looking for personal growth, acceptance, self-confidence, and camaraderie--and, yes, better speaking skills--this is your home.",
