  "testimonial": "I’ve been part of this community for over six months. It’s a uniquely well-managed and organized community. The members are friendly and supportive, and it has helped me overcome my fear of communicating in English fluently and reduced my social anxiety. I’ve also made meaningful connections with people from around the globe. This community showcases the positive side of the internet. With nearly 8 to 10 events each week, members get plenty of practice and exposure. Each event is different, and the prompts are creative and thoughtful. ❤",
