  "testimonial": "Before joining this community, I spent quite a bit of time on other Discord communities trying to improve my speaking skills. However, it felt too time-consuming to learn by talking to many people on those communities, which were often toxic and hectic—especially for someone with social anxiety. When I joined here, the impromptu, role-play, and variety of events were exactly what I was looking for, and they accelerated my progress exponentially. These events are challenging and imaginative, making you think on your feet and step out of your comfort zone—but at your own pace. There's no rush. In this community, it’s okay to make mistakes and blunders; the environment is non-judgmental, and you truly get to learn from your mistakes and keep improving. Beyond the events, you’ll find plenty of people to have deep discussions with, from various backgrounds and fields. You can connect with others working toward similar goals and start activities like small talk practice, deep conversations, interview prep, storytelling, improv, and finding accountability partners. The people here are incredibly wholesome and encouraging. I came to this community to work on my speaking skills but ended up learning much more. I’m now a more articulate, confident, and less anxious person, and I continue to push myself to grow. The possibilities here feel endless. So, if you want to improve your speaking skills, this is the best place you can find—and it’s free!",
