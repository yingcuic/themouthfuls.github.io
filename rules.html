        <h2>Safety & Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          We care deeply about the safety of our Discord community and encourage
          you to contact us for any concerns within the Discord community. Your use
          of Mouthful is subject to
          <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>,
          <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, and
          our Terms of Service. If you are found in violation of either these
          Guidelines or our Terms of Service, Mouthful may remove offending
          content, permanently terminate your account, notify law enforcement,
          or take legal action against you. If your account is terminated or
          disabled for violating our Terms of Service or these Guidelines, you
          may not use the Service again or create a new account without
          Mouthful’s express written consent.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 0: Speak English Only.</h3>
        <p>
          All discussions must be held in English. Users showing a language
          barrier may be asked by staff to take a
          <a href="https://www.efset.org/quick-check/">Proficiency Test</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 1: Be nice.</h3>
        <p>
          Be respectful in your interaction with other members. Welcome new
          members with kindness and empathy.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 2: Be helpful.</h3>
        <p>
          Provide helpful feedback to other members. Focus on what the person is
          doing well when giving feedback (and not just what they can improve
          upon). Be specific, encouraging, and constructive.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 3: Have fun.</h3>
        <p>
          Mouthful is a place for you to enjoy and be yourself. Whether you are
          speaking, listening, playing, or collaborating with others - just
          remember to have fun! And of course, also respect the rights of others
          to do the same.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 4: Be culturally sensitive.</h3>
        <p>
          Remember that Mouthful is a global community. What may seem fun or
          harmless to you could be perceived differently by another member.
          Conversely, what's considered offensive or objectionable in your
          culture may be part of normal conversational topics for others. Strive
          for a balance: respect others' boundaries while also being open to
          diverse perspectives. If misunderstandings arise, approach them with
          patience and a willingness to learn.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 5: Keep your account secure.</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for any activity that occurs on your account, so
          make sure you keep your account secure. Immediately contact moderators
          if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or breach
          of security.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 6: Talk to us.</h3>
        <p>
          You are an integral part of what makes this community great. Moderate
          your own behavior and report others who are not adhering to the rules
          by contacting moderators. Let staff know if you ever have any general
          questions in the get-help channel.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 7: Don't be a bully.</h3>
        <p>
          This goes hand-in-hand with being polite and respectful. Mouthful is
          not a venue for you to harass, abuse, or intimidate others. In fact,
          it’s never okay for you to harass, abuse, or intimidate others. Never.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 8: Prohibition of objectionable content.</h3>
        <p>
          Mouthful reserves the right to review and moderate any content shared
          within the community—this includes, but is not limited to, posts,
          spoken words at events and casual chats, username, "About Me", and
          social media connections. Content that is flagged by members of
          Mouthful or identified by moderators will be scrutinized and may be
          removed if deemed inappropriate or unsafe for the community, or if it
          violates the community rules or Terms of Service. Users may face
          removal and potential bans if they share content that:
        </p>

        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            Bullies, harasses, threatens, intimidates, abuses, or demeans
            others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotes bigotry, discrimination, hatred, intolerance, or racism.
          </li>
          <li>Contains pornographic, obscene, or vulgar material.</li>
          <li>Is hateful, offensive, or designed to shock or disturb.</li>

          <li>Jeopardizes another user’s security or privacy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Rule 9:Don’t be a troll or drama instigator.</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid becoming a burden or a source of ongoing problems for our
          community. If you are found to be toxic, consistently creating
          unnecessary drama, undermining the community’s core mission, or using
          your account to violate the Terms of Service or jeopardize the safety
          or privacy of our users, your account will be subject to sanctions, up
          to and including a ban.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Rule 10: Don’t spam, solicit, promote, or research on our users.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We strictly prohibit any form of spamming, soliciting, self-promotion,
          or marketing research within the Service. This includes, but is not
          limited to:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>Sending invites to other Discord servers</li>
          <li>
            Promoting or selling products and services like apps, speculative
            investments, or artwork
          </li>
          <li>
            Sending mass messages to non-friends or unsolicited friend requests
          </li>
          <li>
            Recruiting attendees for presentations without meeting minimum
            activity requirements or using approved rehearsal channels
          </li>
          <li>
            Gathering information about our users through surveys or other
            methods
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking members to test beta versions of products or prototypes

          <li>Soliciting attendees for external events or activities</li>
          <li>Trying to recruit or poach our community staff</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for any messages you send through Mouthful.
          As Mouthful serves solely as a technology platform, you agree to
          indemnify and hold Mouthful harmless from any claims arising from your
          messages.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Rule 11: Don't give away sensitive information like your password and
          account information.
        </h3>
        <p>
          At Mouthful we work hard to protect your privacy. Be cautious if
          anyone requests your personal or account information.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 12: Don't disrespect the rights or privacy of others.</h3>
        <p>
          By the same token, don’t "dox" or disclose anyone else’s personal
          information. Don't record, screenshot, upload, or livestream images,
          videos or audios of anyone without the express consent of that person.
          Don’t solicit another user’s login credentials or use any other
          person’s account without permission.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 13: Don’t engage in "brigading".</h3>
        <p>
          Don't direct other users to target or flag a particular user (or group
          of users) in an attempt to get the user’s content (or account) removed
          from Mouthful. If you feel another user is violating Mouthful’s Terms
          of Service or Community Guidelines, please contact our moderators.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 14: Don’t disrespect Mouthful.</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t post content or engage in any activity that encourages other
          users to violate our Terms of Service or the Guidelines, and do not
          try to restrict, discourage, or inhibit anyone who is eligible to use
          Mouthful from using the Service. Don’t monitor the Service’s
          availability or functionality or use the Service for any competitive
          purpose, including the development of competing products.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Rule 15: Refrain from any and all other illegal and unauthorized
          activity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          You may not use the Service for any illegal or unlawful purposes, or
          take any action that harms the Service or the use of the Service by
          others. In particular, you may not, for any reason whatsoever:
