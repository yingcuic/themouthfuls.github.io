        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>Last updated: April 19, 2021</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains what information Mouthful
          collects when you use our Services, as well as ways we might use or
          share it and your legal rights. We are committed to protecting the
          privacy of our users. This Policy doesn’t apply to practices of
          companies that we do not own or control, including other companies you
          might interact with on or through the Mouthful services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless indicated otherwise, our Policy applies to all of Mouthful’s
          mobile software applications that have been made available for
          download (each, an "App", and together, the "Apps") and any related
          websites or other online properties owned or controlled by Mouthful
          (together with the Apps, the "Services").
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also read the
          <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a> which
          sets out the terms governing the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we say "Mouthful" (or "we", "us" and "our") we’re referring to
          RiceBox Lab, Inc. We’re a global company headquartered in Toronto,
          Canada.
        </p>
        <h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE</h3>
        <p>
          When we provide the Services, we collect or receive personal
          information in a few different ways. In many cases, you can choose
          what information to provide, although some information is required in
          order to use Mouthful and for us to provide the Services to you. We
          use your information for the purposes described below:
        </p>
        <strong>From you, or from other sources at your direction</strong>
        <p>
          We collect a variety of information from you when you provide it to us
          directly or when you tell us to get it from a third party source. The
          particular kinds of information we gather usually depend on how you
          interact with us. For example:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            We collect basic account information such as your email address,
            phone number, username and password. We need this information to
            create your account and it helps secure and provide access to our
            Services. We also obtain or infer demographic information. If you
            use Facebook or Google to register for or log in to the Services (or
            later connect your accounts), you authorize Facebook or Google, as
            the case may be, to share your personal information with us,
            including your email address, age and publicly available information
            about you and your Facebook friends, if you use Facebook for signup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, if you access the Services with another third party
            social network we will collect information that you have agreed to
            make available, such as your name, user ID/URL, profile picture,
            age, list of friends, email address and/or phone number, and/or your
            birthday, language selected, and/or geolocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            We collect additional profile information about you when you upload
            a picture, or add your interests, skills and what you love.
          </li>
          <li>
            We gather information from the actions you take to recommend,
            create, communicate and share content. This includes messages you
            send, information about the content you create yourself, the people
            you follow, the speeches you mark as favorites or share, and the
            comments you post. In addition, we track social interactions in our
            Apps (e.g. what you watched, what you loved, and your comments and
            invites).
          </li>
          <li>
            We use depth based camera data (which may include facial expression
            mappings) such as those provided by Apple's TrueDepth Camera to
            create and control video and audio effects in your performances.
            Facial expression mappings from this data are only used in real time
            while your camera is active to adapt and synchronize filters and are
            never stored (on device or remotely), shared with third parties, or
            used for any purpose other than creating video and audio effects for
            your performance that you can choose to upload and store.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you send us support requests or comments you may also provide us
            with additional information to enable us to contact you and address
            your feedback and we may retain such information to enhance our
            Services and to respond to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you purchase a subscription, you provide our payment processor
            with your payment information. We currently use third parties to
            process such payments but may change that in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            To be clear, we don’t ask you to provide us with any sensitive
            personal information, such as information relating to your race or
            ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
            beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health,
            genetic or biometric information, sexual life or sexual orientation.
            However, if you decide to share this kind of information on Mouthful
            Services, you explicitly consent to us displaying it or sharing it
            in accordance with your selection.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>From your browser and device</strong>
        <p>
          We collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device,
          which provide us with technical information when you use the Services,
          including:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            If you choose to find your friends on Mouthful, we will access your
            contacts on your device (including contact information your service
            provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you
            communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list) and
            send your contacts to our servers to check if any of them are on the
            Services or the App you are using. If they are, we’ll suggest you
            follow them (but whether you do or not is totally up to you). Each
            time you open the contacts page in the Mouthful app we’ll
            automatically resend the latest version of your contacts to our
            servers and provide you with an updated list of matches. We delete
            your contacts from our servers after we’ve checked for any matches.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you use the Services, we automatically collect certain log
            data, including your IP address, browser type, hardware type, unique
            device ID, the version of your operating system and your activity
            within the Services. We use log data for security purposes (such as
            preventing content from being improperly accessed) and to improve
            our Services (such as enhancing site performance in certain
            regions).
          </li>
          <li>
            We receive device identifiers like Apple’s IDFA, IDFV and Google’s
            AdID. These are principally used for online advertising and
            marketing purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use cookies, which deposit small data files stored on your
            computer or mobile device, and other similar technologies like
            software development kits ("SDKs") or third party libraries. We use
            cookies to distinguish you, identify your interests and your account
            and its status and settings, to collect usage data, keep track of
            your preferences and deliver content specific to your interests. For
            example, we use cookies to remember your volume settings, language
            settings, search history, account type and the last time you checked
            or updated your feed. Our advertising partners may use cookies and
            similar technologies to identify and deliver content and advertising
            specific to your interests, to track the effectiveness of such
            advertising and to provide and analyse their services. You can
            configure your browser to reject cookies. By using our Services you
            consent to our, and our advertising partners’, use of cookies and
            related technologies, and the sharing of data with our advertising
            partners. You can withdraw your consent to our use of cookies using
            your browser settings or your device’s limit ad tracking settings.
            You may also be able to control the use of cookies via industry
            websites such as http://www.aboutads.info/choices and
            http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ or through other functionality
            which we may have available from time to time.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As with any business, we may change or work with different partners
          from time to time. We may provide an updated list of partners in this
          Policy or in another document which we will make available to you.
        </p>
        <h3>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          We use the information we have to help us provide, operate, improve,
          understand, customize, support, and market our Services.
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            In order to register for a Mouthful account, we need certain
            information. We may use your email address and/or phone number to
            send you information about the Services, provide customer support or
            to notify you of additional Mouthful products and services, where
            permitted by applicable law. You may unsubscribe from notifications
            from Mouthful by contacting us at support@themouthfuls.com.
          </li>
          <li>
            We collect information to learn about your use of the Service and to
            enhance your social experience when using the Services, such as
            influencer-follower interaction and notifications, chat, or
            messaging functionality, public leaderboards, head-to-head
            competition such as debates and other similar features. We try to
            show you social content that we think will be of most interest to
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            We try to continuously improve our Services and your experience. As
            part of this, we use the data we have to identify ways to make our
            Services better and more engaging for our users. We use your
            interactions on the Services, along with the other data described in
            this policy, to infer your interests. We do this to identify and
            suggest content that you may like and to tailor advertising,
            including off-site advertising.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use data to identify and respond to potential risks to our users
            and Services (e.g., spammers, phishing attempts, screen scraping,
            bullying and other violations of our
            <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a> and
            <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/guidelines/"
              >Community Guidelines</a
            >).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you provide us with your list of friends on a third party social
            network or a mobile device, your friends on such a network can
            automatically follow you when you use the Services and your Mouthful
            account can be automatically configured to follow your friends. You
            can, however, unfollow any other user on Mouthful at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            We sometimes conduct or sponsor contests. Participation in contests
            is completely voluntary. If you elect to participate, we may ask you
            for contact, demographic, and other information and may ask you to
            agree to additional terms and conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use log data, such as device identifiers, to recognize you and /
            or your devices across different Mouthful applications. We do so to
            provide you with seamless access to another Mouthful application by
            identifying you and making your content available on both
            applications.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. INFORMATION YOU AND WE SHARE</h3>
        <p>
          Mouthful is designed to help you share your speeches around the world.
          Most of the information you provide us through your use of the
          Services is information you are asking us to make public. You share
          your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and
          we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve,
          understand, customize, support, and market our Services.
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            Account Information. Your profile name and photo, bio and status
            including last seen status may be available to anyone who uses our
            Services, although you can configure your settings to manage whether
            certain information is available to other users and businesses with
            whom you communicate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your Content. Your content is published in accordance with your
            privacy settings. Content is public by default. For information
            about how to delete content from the Services, contact us at
            support@themouthfuls.com. If you comment on any content on the
            Services, your comments will be public and available to other users
            of the Services. In certain cases, you may choose to create
            recordings with other Mouthful users. In such cases, it is important
            to remember that you create the content together with another user
            or group of users as a collective. As an individual user within the
            collective, it is difficult if not impossible to undo the creation.
            So, if you create a collaboration with another Mouthful user, you
            won’t be able to change or delete that collaborative work. In
            addition, in such cases, or if they make or contribute to a live
            performance, other users will be able to record and share that
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your Contacts and Others. Users and businesses with whom you
            communicate may store or re-share your information (including your
            messages) with others on and off our Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may share information about you or your use of the Services with
            our advertisers and third party advertising partners. This means
            that we may give our advertisers information about the
            characteristics of our users, along with sharing certain identifiers
            and/or location information, but we do not specifically identify you
            by name or share your contact information. Third parties can use
            this data to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
            be of most interest to you or to assess the effectiveness and reach
            of advertising campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            We work with Google Analytics which collects information such as how
            often users visit our website, what pages they visit when they do
            so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the website.
            You may opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google
            Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-Party Service Providers. We work with third-party service
            providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand,
            customize, support, and market our Services. When we share your
            information with third-party service providers, we require them to
            use your information on our behalf in accordance with our
            instructions and terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any information in your public profile (e.g., your username and any
            profile image, location or additional information that you provide
            as part of your Public Profile, but not your phone number, or email
            address) will be accessible by other users of the Services. Content
            that you create through or upload to the Services will by default be
            public and available to users of the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may publicly disclose aggregated statistics (like what topics are
            popular in a certain city).
          </li>
          <li>
            We may preserve and disclose your information if we believe in good
            faith that we are required to do so in connection with any legal
            investigation or legal complaint, or by law or regulation, including
            in response to a court order, subpoena, regulatory requirement or
            other legal demand or request or if we believe in good faith that it
            is reasonably necessary to protect the safety of any person, to
            address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect Mouthful's
            rights or property, and/or to investigate or assist in preventing
            any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy
            Policy, or our
            <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may use any recording, video and/or other content you create and
            post in the Services in order to promote Mouthful or our Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may share some or all of your information in connection with, or
            during negotiation of, any merger, financing, acquisition or
            dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer,
            divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or
            assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership,
            information may also be transferred as a business asset.
          </li>
        </ol>

          4. OUR LEGAL BASES FOR COLLECTING, USING, SHARING AND OTHERWISE
          PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION
        </h3>
        <p>
          For the purposes of EU law, Mouthful relies on a number of legal bases
          to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have
          about you for the purposes described in this Policy. These legal bases
          include:
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            Certain processing is necessary to provide the Services in
            accordance with the
            <a href="https://themouthfuls.com/terms/">Terms of Service</a>. For
            example, we need to disseminate your content to provide our Service.
            We need basic contact information in order to register you for a
            Mouthful account and to share content on Mouthful, which is at the
            heart of our Service;
          </li>
          <li>
            Where you have consented to certain processing. For example we may
            send you marketing messages if you have consented to receiving them,
            or we may ask you if you want to take part in voluntary contests.
            You may revoke that consent at any time;
          </li>
          <li>
            For Mouthful to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to
            exercise and defend legal claims, to protect your vital interests or
            those of others, or where the processing is necessary in the public
            interest. For example, we may share data where we are required by
            law to do so; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Some processing is necessary because it is in Mouthful’s or a third
            party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members or
            partners.
          </li>
          <strong>Our legitimate interests</strong>
          <p>
            We process your information in furtherance of the following
            legitimate interests:
          </p>
          <ol class="alpha-list">
            <li>
              Keeping the Services safe and secure: We use your information to
              try and keep our Services safe and secure. We do so as it is
              necessary to pursue our legitimate interests, the interests of our
              community and yours, in ensuring Mouthful is secure, and to
              protect against fraud, spam, misuse and abuse. For example, we
              process your information to protect you and Mouthful from
              malicious scraping of our website by those seeking to download
              speeches. We also want to protect against hackers who try to
              access content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing our Services: We use your information to provide the
              Services, including any personalized services. We do so as it is
              necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in providing an
              innovative and tailored offering to our users on a sustained basis
              and to provide stable connectivity. For example, where there is
              poor connectivity in an area or neighbourhood, users can
              experience difficulty in downloading/uploading content. In that
              case, Mouthful needs to process log data, including your IP
              address, to troubleshoot the issue. Without your IP address and
              location info, it can be hard to fix connectivity issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learning how we can improve your experience on our Services, and
              contributing to research: We work hard to develop, enhance and
              improve our Services, such as by providing better speech
              recommendations. We also share data with researchers to contribute
              to academic research. Where we contribute to academic research, we
              take into account your rights and ensure that protections are in
              place with respect to your information.

        <h3>5. MANAGING AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
          We offer the ability to correct or update the information collected
          during registration via your account settings on our website or the
          applicable App or by contacting support via support@themouthfuls.com
          and we rely on the accuracy of the information you provide us (such as
          your age). You may request deletion of your account by contacting
          support via support@themouthfuls.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain your information in our server logs, our databases and our
          records only for as long as necessary in light of the purposes set out
          in this Policy, subject to any legal obligations to further retain
          such information. We may use third party service providers to store
          and maintain such data. We retain your verification-related
          information for a reasonable period of time, even if you do not
          complete all verification steps, to assist with future verifications
          and to prevent abuse of our verification processes. If you decide not
          to verify the account and would like us to delete the verification
          information you provided, contact support via
          support@themouthfuls.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you create content with other users such group content will remain
          after you delete your account.
        </p>
        <h3>6. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
        <p>
          If you reside in certain territories, including the European Economic
          Area, you benefit from a number of rights in relation to your
          information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain
          rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights
          below in a summary format, but mandated applicable law shall govern.
        </p>
        <ol class="alpha-list">
          <li>
            Access and Porting. You can access much of your information by
            logging into your account. Where legally required, we can provide
            your information upon your request. Note that, in accordance with
            applicable law, information will not be provided where doing so
            would adversely affect the rights (including the intellectual
            property rights) of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change, Restrict, Limit, Delete. You can also change, restrict,
            limit or delete much of your information by logging into your
            account. If you cannot do this, or you do not have a Mouthful
            account, contact support via support@themouthfuls.com. We may retain
            certain information as required by applicable law.
          </li>
          <li>
            Object. If we process your information based on our legitimate
            interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object
            to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will
            cease processing your information unless we have compelling
            legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for
            legal reasons. If you live in the European Economic Area, you also
            have a general right to object to the use of your information for
            direct marketing purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Revoke consent. Where you have previously provided your consent, you
            have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your
            information at any time. For example, you can withdraw your consent
            to email marketing, or revoke any consent you have provided to our
            use of your geo-location information by contacting us at
            support@themouthfuls.com. If you withdraw your consent to the use of
            your information for purposes set out in this Policy, you may not
            have access to all (or any) of our Services and we might not be able
            to provide you all (or any) of the Services. In certain cases, we
            may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn
            consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your withdrawal of
            consent was limited to certain processing activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complain. If you reside in the European Economic Area, should you
            wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and
            without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the
            right to do so with your local data protection authority.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>7. SECURITY</h3>
        <p>
          We maintain technical and organisational measures to protect against
          accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
          disclosure of, or access to your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We endeavor to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks
          that are presented by the processing, having all due regard to the
          state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope,
          context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk to users.
          No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
          storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we use reasonable
          efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
          security.
        </p>
        <h3>8. DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
        <p>
          When you use our Services your personal information is transferred to
          Canada, where the laws protecting privacy may be less stringent than
          those in your home country. We’re a Canadian company, based in
          Toronto, so this transfer is necessary for the performance of our
          Terms of Service. In certain cases, your data may be transferred to
          other countries or made available to users in other countries as part
          of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain cases, we may use a legal mechanism known as "standard
          contractual clauses" to protect information transferred outside the
          EU. Standard contractual clauses refer to contracts between companies
          transferring personal information that contain standard commitments
          approved by the EU Commission protecting the privacy and security of
          the information transferred. You can contact us to learn more and to
          request a copy of any clauses which may relate to your data.
        </p>
        <h3>9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
        <p>
          Our Services are intended for general audiences, and are not intended
          for anyone under 13, anyone under 16 in the European Economic Area or
          anyone under the minimum age to use the Services in the jurisdiction
          where they reside ("Minimum Age"). Persons under the Minimum age are
          prohibited from using our Services and we do not knowingly collect
          information from such individuals. If we become aware that a child
          under the Minimum Age has provided us with their information, we take
          steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account,
          unless proper parental consent is delivered to Mouthful.
        </p>
        <h3>10. CONTACT US</h3>

          any statutory rights, please contact us via support@themouthfuls.com.
